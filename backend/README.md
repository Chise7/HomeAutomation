Backend Specific Information-

In Order to maintain privacy, I have included a core/private.py

To operate this code, you will need to include a file, private.py, into your core folder with the following structure:

# private.py
class private:
    sender = "example@email.com"
    reciever ="example@email.com"
    sender_password = "password"
    host= "smtp.email.com"
